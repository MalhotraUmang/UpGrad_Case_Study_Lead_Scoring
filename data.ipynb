    "\n",
    "X Education company, who sells online courses to industry professionals, gets its initial leads from online marketing on various websites. Leads implies people who might be interested to join their courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company wishes to identify the most potential leads i.e. Hot Leads, some of which get converted and join their courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, the sales team can focus more on communicating with the hot leads rather than making calls to everyone (from the pool of initial leads).\n",
    "\n",
    "Their current lead conversion rate is quite poor i.e. 30%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CEO has given a target to increase their lead conversion rate to 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, a model needs to be built which assigns lead score to each of the leads.\n",
    "A customer assigned with a higher lead score would mean a higher conversion chance and \n",
